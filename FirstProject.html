        <p>The Old Man and the Sea is a short novel written by the American author Ernest 
            Hemingway in 1951 in Cuba, and published in 1952. It was the last 
            major work of fiction by Hemingway that was published during his lifetime. 
            One of his most famous works, it tells the story of Santiago, an aging Cuban 
            fisherman who struggles with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream off the 
            coast of Cuba.</p>
        <p>In 1953, The Old Man and the Sea was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and it
             was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to their awarding of the Nobel Prize in 
             Literature to Hemingway in 1954.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>The Old Man and the Sea tells the story of a battle between an aging, 
            experienced fisherman, Santiago, and a large marlin. The story opens with Santiago 
            having gone 84 days without catching a fish, and now being seen as "salao", the worst
            form of unluckiness. He is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been
            forbidden by his parents to sail with him and has been told instead to fish with
            successful fishermen. The boy visits Santiago's shack each night, hauling his
            fishing gear, preparing food, talking about American baseball and his favorite
            player, Joe DiMaggio. Santiago tells Manolin that on the next day, he will 
            venture far out into the Gulf Stream, north of Cuba in the Straits of Florida 
            to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.</p>
        <p>On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago takes his skiff into
            the Gulf Stream, sets his lines and by noon, has his bait taken by a big
            fish that he is sure is a marlin. Unable to haul in the great marlin, 
            antiago is instead pulled by the marlin, and two days and nights pass 
            with Santiago holding onto the line. Though wounded by the struggle and 
            in pain, Santiago expresses a compassionate appreciation for his adversary, 
            often referring to him as a brother. He also determines that, because of 
            the fish's great dignity, no one shall deserve to eat the marlin.</p>
        <p>On the third day, the fish begins to circle the skiff. 
            Santiago, worn out and almost delirious, uses all his 
            remaining strength to pull the fish onto its side and 
            stab the marlin with a harpoon. Santiago straps the marlin 
            to the side of his skiff and heads home, thinking about 
            the high price the fish will bring him at the market and 
            how many people he will feed.</p>
        <p>On his way in to shore, sharks are attracted to the 
            marlin's blood. Santiago kills a great mako shark with his harpoon, 
            but he loses the weapon. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his 
            knife to the end of an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; 
            five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks
            keep coming, and by nightfall the sharks have almost devoured 
            the marlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly
            of its backbone, its tail and its head. Santiago knows that he
            is defeated and tells the sharks of how they have killed his
            dreams. Upon reaching the shore before dawn on the next day,
            Santiago struggles to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on
            his shoulder, leaving the fish head and the bones on the shore.
            Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep.</p>
        <p>A group of fishermen gather the next day around the boat where
            the fish's skeleton is still attached. One of the fishermen measures
            it to be 18 feet (5.5 m) from nose to tail. Pedrico is given
            the head of the fish, and the other fishermen tell Manolin
            to tell the old man how sorry they are. Tourists at the nearby
            café mistakenly take it for a shark. The boy, worried about
            the old man, cries upon finding him safe asleep and at his
            injured hands. Manolin brings him newspapers and coffee. 
            When the old man wakes, they promise to fish together once again. 
            Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth—of
            lions on an African beach.</p>
